# Bank Customer Segmentation (KMeans Clustering) 🏦📊

This project demonstrates how to apply **KMeans Clustering** for customer segmentation in the banking sector. By grouping similar customers together based on spending behavior and income, banks can design more targeted marketing strategies and improve customer experience.

## 📁 Project Structure

- `Bank Customer Segmentation (KMeans Clustering).ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook showcasing the full customer segmentation pipeline.
- `Bank_Churn.csv`: Primary dataset containing customer data.
- `Bank_Churn_Data_Dictionary.csv`: Description of all features in the dataset.
- `Bank_Churn_Messy.xlsx`: Alternate version of the dataset for data cleaning and preprocessing practice.
- `README.md`: Overview and guide for the project.

## 🎯 Objective

To perform unsupervised customer segmentation using the KMeans clustering algorithm. The primary goal is to identify distinct groups of customers based on key features like income, age, and spending habits.

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used

- **Python** 🐍
- **Pandas** – Data manipulation
- **NumPy** – Numerical computing
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – Data visualization
- **Scikit-learn** – Machine learning algorithms (KMeans)

## 🔍 Workflow Overview

1. **Data Exploration & Preprocessing**
   - Loading and cleaning the dataset
   - Handling missing values, encoding if needed
2. **Feature Selection**
   - Choosing relevant features for clustering
3. **Elbow Method**
   - Identifying the optimal number of clusters
4. **KMeans Clustering**
   - Training the model and assigning clusters
5. **Visualization**
